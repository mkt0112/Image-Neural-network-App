Features:
- Select an image from the gallery or capture one using the device's camera.
- Perform image classification on the selected image.
- Display the predicted label for the image based on the trained model.
- Supports classification of various objects, animals, and scenes.

Installation:
To use Image, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the application on an Android device or emulator.
